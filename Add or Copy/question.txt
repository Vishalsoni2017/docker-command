You can use ADD and COPY to perform the same action: copy a file. However, it is recomended to use only COPY for that. Modify existed /root/Dockerfile :

  copy file copy_file.txt with keyword COPY
  copy file add_file.txt with keywork ADD
  build image app-image , confirm that files were copied to the container
